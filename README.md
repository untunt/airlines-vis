# Airlines Routes Visualization using D3

This project uses the dataset file [routes.csv](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/x/9QmJrb) storing airline data and the GeoJSON file [contries.geo.json](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/blob/master/countries.geo.json) to draw the map. Please put them in the same folder with index.html.
